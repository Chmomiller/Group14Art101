            <h2> What is a Surgical Mask? </h2>
          		<p> A surgical mask is a disposable type of mask intended for medical use.
								It primarily protects the users nose and mouth from droplets that contain germs, and can filter out
								large particles in the air. It also protects other people from germs the wearer could possibly have. </p>
