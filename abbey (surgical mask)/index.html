            <h2> What is a Surgical Mask? </h2>
              <p> A surgical mask is a disposable type of mask intended for medical use.
                It primarily protects the users nose and mouth from droplets that contain germs, and can filter out
                large particles in the air. It also protects other people from germs the wearer could possibly have. </p>

   <h2> How to Get a Surgical Mask </h2>
            <p> Actually, its best not to try and get a surgical mask since the health care
              industry has so few of them. You can find them from medical suppliers,
              but an everyday person can get the same benefits from masks less highly in demand. </p>
